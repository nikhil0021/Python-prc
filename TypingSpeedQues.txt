Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. -Ralph Waldo Emerson ;Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough. -Oprah Winfrey ;If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. -James Cameron ;Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. -John Lennon ;The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart. -Helen Keller ;You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. -Dr. Seuss
